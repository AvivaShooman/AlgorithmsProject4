Now the earth was astonishingly empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated between the light and between the darkness.And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night, and it was evening and it was morning, one day.And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water."And God made the expanse and it separated between the water that was below the expanse and the water that was above the expanse, and it was so.And God called the expanse Heaven, and it was evening, and it was morning, a second day.And God said, "Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear," and it was so.And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas, and God saw that it was good.And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, seed yielding herbs and fruit trees producing fruit according to its kind in which its seed is found, on the earth," and it was so.And the earth gave forth vegetation, seed yielding herbs according to its kind, and trees producing fruit, in which its seed is found, according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.And it was evening, and it was morning, a third day.And God said, "Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to separate between the day and between the night, and they shall be for signs and for appointed seasons and for days and years.And they shall be for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens to shed light upon the earth." And it was so.And God made the two great luminaries: the great luminary to rule the day and the lesser luminary to rule the night, and the stars.And God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to shed light upon the earth.And to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and between the darkness, and God saw that it was good.And it was evening, and it was morning, a fourth day.And God said, "Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures, and let fowl fly over the earth, across the expanse of the heavens."And God created the great sea monsters, and every living creature that crawls, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged fowl, according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the fowl multiply upon the earth."And it was evening, and it was morning, a fifth day.And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and the beasts of the earth according to their kind," and it was so.And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind, and all the creeping things of the ground according to their kind, and God saw that it was good.And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heaven and over the animals and over all the earth and over all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."And God created man in His image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the sky and over all the beasts that tread upon the earth. "And God said, "Behold, I have given you every seed bearing herb, which is upon the surface of the entire earth, and every tree that has seed bearing fruit; it will be yours for food.And to all the beasts of the earth and to all the fowl of the heavens, and to everything that moves upon the earth, in which there is a living spirit, every green herb to eat," and it was so.And God saw all that He had made, and behold it was very good, and it was evening and it was morning, the sixth day.1Now the heavens and the earth were completed and all their host.2And God completed on the seventh day His work that He did, and He abstained on the seventh day from all His work that He did.3And God blessed the seventh day and He hallowed it, for thereon He abstained from all His work that God created to do.4These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.5Now no tree of the field was yet on the earth, neither did any herb of the field yet grow, because the Lord God had not brought rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the soil.6And a mist ascended from the earth and watered the entire surface of the ground.7And the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and He breathed into his nostrils the soul of life, and man became a living soul.8And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden from the east, and He placed there the man whom He had formed.9And the Lord God caused to sprout from the ground every tree pleasant to see and good to eat, and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil.10And a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it separated and became four heads.11The name of one is Pishon; that is the one that encompasses all the land of Havilah, where there is gold.12And the gold of that land is good; there is the crystal and the onyx stone.13And the name of the second river is Gihon; that is the one that encompasses all the land of Cush.14And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is the one that flows to the east of Assyria, and the fourth river that is the Euphrates.15Now the Lord God took the man, and He placed him in the Garden of Eden to work it and to guard it.16And the Lord God commanded man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat.17But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die."18And the Lord God said, "It is not good that man is alone; I shall make him a helpmate opposite him."19And the Lord God formed from the earth every beast of the field and every fowl of the heavens, and He brought to man to see what he would call it, and whatever the man called each living thing, that was its name.20And man named all the cattle and the fowl of the heavens and all the beasts of the field, but for man, he did not find a helpmate opposite him.21And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon man, and he slept, and He took one of his sides, and He closed the flesh in its place.22And the Lord God built the side that He had taken from man into a woman, and He brought her to man.23And man said, "This time, it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one shall be called ishah (woman) because this one was taken from ish (man)."24Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.25Now they were both naked, the man and his wife, but they were not ashamed.1Now the serpent was cunning, more than all the beasts of the field that the Lord God had made, and it said to the woman, "Did God indeed say, 'You shall not eat of any of the trees of the garden?'"2And the woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat.3But of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God said, "You shall not eat of it, and you shall not touch it, lest you die.'"4And the serpent said to the woman, "You will surely not die.5For God knows that on the day that you eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like angels, knowing good and evil."6And the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise; so she took of its fruit, and she ate, and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.7And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves and made themselves girdles.8And they heard the voice of the Lord God going in the garden to the direction of the sun, and the man and his wife hid from before the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden.9And the Lord God called to man, and He said to him, "Where are you?"10And he said, "I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I am naked; so I hid."11And He said, "Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"12And the man said, "The woman whom You gave with me she gave me of the tree; so I ate."13And the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" And the woman said, "The serpent enticed me, and I ate."14And the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed be you more than all the cattle and more than all the beasts of the field; you shall walk on your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.15And I shall place hatred between you and between the woman, and between your seed and between her seed. He will crush your head, and you will bite his heel."16To the woman He said, "I shall surely increase your sorrow and your pregnancy; in pain you shall bear children. And to your husband will be your desire, and he will rule over you."17And to man He said, "Because you listened to your wife, and you ate from the tree from which I commanded you saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed be the ground for your sake; with toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life.18And it will cause thorns and thistles to grow for you, and you shall eat the herbs of the field.19With the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground, for you were taken therefrom, for dust you are, and to dust you will return."20And the man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all life.21And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife shirts of skin, and He dressed them.22Now the Lord God said, "Behold man has become like one of us, having the ability of knowing good and evil, and now, lest he stretch forth his hand and take also from the Tree of Life and eat and live forever."23And the Lord God sent him out of the Garden of Eden, to till the soil, whence he had been taken.24And He drove the man out, and He stationed from the east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim and the blade of the revolving sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Life.1Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, and she said, "I have acquired a man with the Lord."2And she continued to bear his brother Abel, and Abel was a shepherd of flocks, and Cain was a tiller of the soil.3Now it came to pass at the end of days, that Cain brought of the fruit of the soil an offering to the Lord.4And Abel he too brought of the firstborn of his flocks and of their fattest, and the Lord turned to Abel and to his offering.5But to Cain and to his offering He did not turn, and it annoyed Cain exceedingly, and his countenance fell.6And the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you annoyed, and why has your countenance fallen?7Is it not so that if you improve, it will be forgiven you? If you do not improve, however, at the entrance, sin is lying, and to you is its longing, but you can rule over it."8And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.9And the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" And he said, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"10And He said, "What have you done? Hark! Your brother's blood cries out to Me from the earth.11And now, you are cursed even more than the ground, which opened its mouth to take your brother's blood from your hand.12When you till the soil, it will not continue to give its strength to you; you shall be a wanderer and an exile in the land."13And Cain said to the Lord, "Is my iniquity too great to bear?14Behold You have driven me today off the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from before You, and I will be a wanderer and an exile in the land, and it will be that whoever finds me will kill me."15And the Lord said to him, "Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be wrought upon him sevenfold," and the Lord placed a mark on Cain that no one who find him slay him.16And Cain went forth from before the Lord, and he dwelt in the land of the wanderers, to the east of Eden.17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch, and he was building a city, and he called the city after the name of his son, Enoch.18And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehijael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lemech.19And Lemech took himself two wives; one was named Adah, and the other was named Zillah.20Now Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.21And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who grasp a lyre and a flute.22And Zillah she too bore Tubal-cain, who sharpened all tools that cut copper and iron, and Tubal-cain's sister was Na'amah.23Now Lemech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hearken to my voice; wives of Lemech, incline your ears to my words, for I have slain a man by wounding (him) and a child by bruising (him).24If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then for Lemech it shall be seventy seven fold."25And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and she named him Seth, for God has given me other seed, instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.26And to Seth also to him a son was born, and he named him Enosh; then it became common to call by the name of the Lord.1This is the narrative of the generations of man; on the day that God created man, in the likeness of God He created him.2Male and female He created them, and He blessed them, and He named them man (Adam) on the day they were created.3And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and he begot in his likeness after his image, and he named him Seth.4And the days of Adam after he begot Seth were eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.5And all the days of Adam that he lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.6And Seth lived one hundred and five years, and he begot Enosh.7And Seth lived after he had begotten Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and he begot sons and daughters.8And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.9And Enosh lived ninety years, and he begot Kenan.10And Enosh lived after he had begotten Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and he begot sons and daughters.11And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and he died.12And Kenan lived seventy years, and he begot Mahalalel.13And Kenan lived after he had begotten Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and he begot sons and daughters.14And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.15And Mahalalel lived sixty five years, and he begot Jared.16And Mahalalel lived after he had begotten Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and he begot sons and daughters.17And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety five years, and he died.18And Jared lived a hundred and sixty two years, and he begot Enoch.19And Jared lived after he had begotten Enoch eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.20And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty two years, and he died.21And Enoch lived sixty five years, and he begot Methuselah.22And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methuselah, three hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.23And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty five years.24And Enoch walked with God, and he was no longer, for God had taken him.25And Methuselah lived a hundred and eighty seven years, and he begot Lamech.26And Methuselah lived after he had begotten Lamech, seven hundred and eighty two years, and he begot sons and daughters.27And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty nine years, and he died.28And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty two years, and he begot a son.29And he named him Noah, saying, "This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands from the ground, which the Lord has cursed."30And Lamech lived after he had begotten Noah, five hundred and ninety five years, and he begot sons and daughters.31And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy seven years, and he died.32And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.1And it came to pass when man commenced to multiply upon the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them.2That the sons of the nobles saw the daughters of man when they were beautifying themselves, and they took for themselves wives from whomever they chose.3And the Lord said, "Let My spirit not quarrel forever concerning man, because he is also flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."4The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of the nobles would come to the daughters of man, and they would bear for them; they are the mighty men, who were of old, the men of renown.5And the Lord saw that the evil of man was great in the earth, and every imagination of his heart was only evil all the time.6And the Lord regretted that He had made man upon the earth, and He became grieved in His heart.7And the Lord said, "I will blot out man, whom I created, from upon the face of the earth, from man to cattle to creeping thing, to the fowl of the heavens, for I regret that I made them."8But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.9These are the generations of Noah, Noah was a righteous man he was perfect in his generations; Noah walked with God.10And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.11Now the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth became full of robbery.12And God saw the earth, and behold it had become corrupted, for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth.13And God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth has become full of robbery because of them, and behold I am destroying them from the earth.14Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with compartments, and you shall caulk it both inside and outside with pitch.15And this you shall make it: three hundred cubits the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height.16You shall make a skylight for the ark, and to a cubit you shall finish it to the top, and the entrance of the ark you shall place in its side; you shall make it with bottom [compartments], second story, and third story.17And I, behold I am bringing the flood, water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which there is the spirit of life, from beneath the heavens; all that is upon the earth will perish.18And I will set up My covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you and your sons, and your wife and your sons' wives with you.19And of all living things of all flesh, two of each you shall bring into the ark to preserve alive with you; they shall be male and female.20Of the fowl after its kind and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing upon the ground after its kind; two of each shall come to you to preserve alive.21And you, take for yourself of every food that is eaten and gather it in to you, and it shall be for you and for them to eat."22And Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.1And the Lord said to Noah, "Come into the ark, you and all your household, for it is you that I have seen as a righteous man before Me in this generation.2Of all the clean animals you shall take for yourself seven pairs, a male and its mate, and of the animals that are not clean, two, a male and its mate.3Also, of the fowl of the heavens, seven pairs, male and female, to keep seed alive on the face of the earth.4For in another seven days, I will make it rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out all beings that I have made, off the face of the earth."5And Noah did, according to all that the Lord had commanded him.6And Noah was six hundred years old, and the flood came about, water upon the earth.7And Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him into the ark because of the flood waters.8Of the clean beasts and of the beasts that are not clean, and of the fowl, and all that creeps upon the earth.9Two by two they came to Noah to the ark, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.10And it came to pass after the seven days, that the flood waters were upon the earth.11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on this day, all the springs of the great deep were split, and the windows of the heavens opened up.12And the rain was upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.13On this very day, Noah came, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, Noah's sons, and Noah's wife and his sons' three wives with them, into the ark.14They, and every beast after its kind, and every domestic animal after its kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird of every wing.15And they came to Noah to the ark, two by two of all flesh in which there is the spirit of life.16And those who came male and female of all flesh came, as God had commanded him, and the Lord shut him in.17Now the Flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased, and they lifted the ark, and it rose off the earth.18And the waters became powerful, and they increased very much upon the earth, and the ark moved upon the waters.19And the waters became exceedingly powerful upon the earth, and all the lofty mountains that were under the heavens were covered up.20Fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail, and the mountains were covered up.21And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, among the fowl, and among the cattle, and among the beasts, and among all creeping creatures that creep upon the earth and all mankind.22Everything that had the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils, of all that were on the dry land, died.23And it blotted out all beings that were upon the face of the earth, from man to animal to creeping thing and to the fowl of the heavens, and they were blotted out from the earth, and only Noah and those with him in the ark survived.24And the water prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.1And God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark, and God caused a spirit to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.2And the springs of the deep were closed, and the windows of the heavens, and the rain from the heavens was withheld.3And the waters receded off the earth more and more, and the water diminished at the end of a hundred and fifty days.4And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.5And the waters constantly diminished until the tenth month; in the tenth, on the first of the month, the mountain peaks appeared.6And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made.7And he sent forth the raven, and it went out, back and forth until the waters dried up off the earth.8And he sent forth the dove from with him, to see whether the waters had abated from upon the surface of the earth.9But the dove found no resting place for the sole of its foot; so it returned to him to the ark because there was water upon the entire surface of the earth; so he stretched forth his hand and took it, and he brought it to him to the ark.10And he waited again another seven days, and he again sent forth the dove from the ark.11And the dove returned to him at eventide, and behold it had plucked an olive leaf in its mouth; so Noah knew that the water had abated from upon the earth.12And he again waited another seven days, and he sent forth the dove, and it no longer continued to return to him.13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first, on the first of the month, that the waters dried up from upon the earth, and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and he saw, and behold, the surface of the ground had dried up.14And in the second month, on the twenty seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.15And God spoke to Noah saying:16"Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons, and your sons' wives with you.17Every living thing that is with you of all flesh, of fowl, and of animals and of all the creeping things that creep on the earth, bring out with you, and they shall swarm upon the earth, and they shall be fruitful and multiply upon the earth."18So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.19Every beast, every creeping thing, and all fowl, everything that moves upon the earth, according to their families they went forth from the ark.20And Noah built an altar to the Lord, and he took of all the clean animals and of all the clean fowl and brought up burnt offerings on the altar.21And the Lord smelled the pleasant aroma, and the Lord said to Himself, "I will no longer curse the earth because of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and I will no longer smite all living things as I have done.22So long as the earth exists, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."1And God blessed Noah and his sons, and He said to them: "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.2And your fear and your dread shall be upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the fowl of the heaven; upon everything that creeps upon the ground and upon all the fish of the sea, they have been given into your hand[s].3Every moving thing that lives shall be yours to eat; like the green vegetation, I have given you everything.4But, flesh with its soul, its blood, you shall not eat.5But your blood, of your souls, I will demand; from the hand of every beast I will demand it, and from the hand of man, from the hand of each man, his brother, I will demand the soul of man.6Whoever sheds the blood of man through man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God He made man.7And you, be fruitful and multiply; swarm upon the earth and multiply thereon."8And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:9"And I, behold I am setting up My covenant with you and with your seed after you.10And with every living creature that is with you, among the fowl, among the cattle, and among all the beasts of the earth with you, of all those who came out of the ark, of all the living creatures of the earth.11And I will establish My covenant with you, and never again will all flesh be cut off by the flood waters, and there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth."12And God said: "This is the sign of the covenant, which I am placing between Me and between you, and between every living soul that is with you, for everlasting generations.13My rainbow I have placed in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Myself and the earth.14And it shall come to pass, when I cause clouds to come upon the earth, that the rainbow will appear in the cloud.15And I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and between you and between every living creature among all flesh, and the water will no longer become a flood to destroy all flesh.16And the rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will see it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and between every living creature among all flesh, which is on the earth."17And God said to Noah: "This is the sign of the covenant that I have set up, between Myself and between all flesh that is on the earth."18And the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham he was the father of Canaan.19These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the entire earth spread out.20And Noah began to be a master of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.21And he drank of the wine and became drunk, and he uncovered himself within his tent.22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside.23And Shem and Japheth took the garment, and they placed on both of their shoulders, and they walked backwards, and they covered their father's nakedness, and their faces were turned backwards, so that they did not see their father's nakedness.24And Noah awoke from his wine, and he knew what his small son had done to him.25And he said, "Cursed be Canaan; he shall be a slave among slaves to his brethren."26And he said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem, and may Canaan be a slave to them.27May God expand Japheth, and may He dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be a slave to them."28And Noah lived after the Flood, three hundred and fifty years.29And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.1And these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and sons were born to them after the Flood.2The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal, and Meshech and Tiras.3And the sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.4And the sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.5From these, the islands of the nations separated in their lands, each one to his language, according to their families, in their nations.6And the sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.7And the sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabta and Raamah and Sabtecha, and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.8And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty man in the land.9He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord."10And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.11From that land emerged Asshur, and he built Nineveh and Rehoboth ir and Calah.12And Resen, between Nineveh and between Calah; that is the great city.13And Mizraim begot the Ludim and the Anamim and the Lehabim and the Naphtuhim,14And the Pathrusim and the Casluhim, from whom the Philistines emerged, and the Caphtorim.15And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn and Heth.16And the Jebusites and the Amorites and the Girgashites.17And the Hivvites and the Arkites and the Sinites.18And the Arvadites and the Zemarites and the Hamathites, and afterwards the families of the Canaanites were scattered.19And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you come to Gerar, until Gaza, as you come to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboiim, until Lesha.20These are the sons of Ham according to their families, and their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.21And to Shem were also born the father of all the people of the other side, the brother of Japheth the elder.22The sons of Shem were Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.23And the sons of Aram were Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.24And Arpachshad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Eber.25And to Eber were born two sons: one was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and the name of his brother was Joktan.26And Joktan begot Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah.27And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah.28And Obal and Abimael and Sheba.29And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.30And their settlement was from Mesha, as you come to Sephar, the mountain of the east.31These are the sons of Shem according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.32These are the families of the sons of Noah according to their generations, in their nations, and from these, the nations were separated on the earth after the Flood.1Now the entire earth was of one language and uniform words.2And it came to pass when they traveled from the east, that they found a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there.3And they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and fire them thoroughly"; so the bricks were to them for stones, and the clay was to them for mortar.4And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered upon the face of the entire earth."5And the Lord descended to see the city and the tower that the sons of man had built.6And the Lord said, "Lo! [they are] one people, and they all have one language, and this is what they have commenced to do. Now, will it not be withheld from them, all that they have planned to do?7Come, let us descend and confuse their language, so that one will not understand the language of his companion."8And the Lord scattered them from there upon the face of the entire earth, and they ceased building the city.9Therefore, He named it Babel, for there the Lord confused the language of the entire earth, and from there the Lord scattered them upon the face of the entire earth.10These are the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and he begot Arpachshad, two years after the Flood.11And Shem lived after he had begotten Arpachshad five hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.12And Arpachshad lived thirty five years, and he begot Shelah.13And Arpachshad lived after he had begotten Shelah four hundred and three years, and he begot sons and daughters.14And Shelah lived thirty years, and he begot Eber.15And Shelah lived after he had begotten Eber, four hundred and three years, and he begot sons and daughters.16And Eber lived thirty four years, and he begot Peleg.17And Eber lived after he had begotten Peleg, four hundred and thirty years, and he begot sons and daughters.18And Peleg lived thirty years, and he begot Reu.19And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu, two hundred and nine years, and he begot sons and daughters.20And Reu lived thirty two years, and he begot Serug.21And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred and seven years, and he begot sons and daughters.22And Serug lived thirty years, and he begot Nahor.23And Serug lived after he had begotten Nahor, two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.24And Nahor lived twenty nine years, and he begot Terah.25And Nahor lived after he had begotten Terah one hundred and nineteen years, and he begot sons and daughters.26And Terah lived seventy years, and he begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.27And these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran begot Lot.28And Haran died during the lifetime of Terah his father in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.29And Abram and Nahor took themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.30And Sarai was barren; she had no child.31And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go to the land of Canaan, and they came as far as Haran and settled there.32And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.1And the Lord said to Abram, "Go forth from your land and from your birthplace and from your father's house, to the land that I will show you.2And I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will aggrandize your name, and be a blessing.3And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse, and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you."4And Abram went, as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him, and Abram was seventy five years old when he left Haran.5And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had acquired, and the souls they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go to the land of Canaan, and they came to the land of Canaan.6And Abram passed through the land, until the place of Shechem, until the plain of Moreh, and the Canaanites were then in the land.7And the Lord appeared to Abram, and He said, "To your seed I will give this land," and there he built an altar to the Lord, Who had appeared to him.8And he moved from there to the mountain, east of Beth el, and he pitched his tent; Beth el was to the west and Ai was to the east, and there he built an altar to the Lord, and he called in the name of the Lord.9And Abram traveled, continually traveling southward.10And there was a famine in the land, and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there because the famine was severe in the land.11Now it came to pass when he drew near to come to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, "Behold now I know that you are a woman of fair appearance.12And it will come to pass when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, 'This is his wife,' and they will slay me and let you live.13Please say you are my sister, in order that it go well with me because of you, and that my soul may live because of you."14And it came to pass when Abram came to Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very pretty.15And Pharaoh's princes saw her, and they praised her to Pharaoh, and the woman was taken to the house of Pharaoh.16And he benefited Abram for her sake, and he had flocks and cattle and he donkeys and men servants and maid servants, and she donkeys and camels.17And the Lord plagued Pharaoh [with] great plagues as well as his household, on account of Sarai, Abram's wife.18And Pharaoh summoned Abram, and he said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?19Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to myself for a wife? And now, here is your wife; take [her] and go."20And Pharaoh commanded men on his behalf, and they escorted him and his wife and all that was his.1And Abram came up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was his, and Lot with him, to the south.2And Abram was very heavy with cattle, with silver, and with gold.3And he went on his journeys, from the south and until Beth el, until the place where his tent had been previously, between Beth el and between Ai.4To the place of the altar that he had made at first, and Abram called there in the name of the Lord.5And also Lot, who went with Abram, had flocks and cattle and tents.6And the land did not bear them to dwell together, for their possessions were many, and they could not dwell together.7And there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and between the herdsmen of Lot's cattle, and the Canaanites and the Perizzites were then dwelling in the land.8And Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no quarrel between me and between you and between my herdsmen and between your herdsmen, for we are kinsmen.9Is not all the land before you? Please part from me; if [you go] left, I will go right, and if [you go] right, I will go left."10And Lot raised his eyes, and he saw the entire plain of the Jordan, that it was entirely watered; before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.11And Lot chose for himself the entire plain of the Jordan, and Lot traveled from the east, and they parted from one another.12Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and he pitched his tents until Sodom.13And the people of Sodom were very evil and sinful against the Lord.14And the Lord said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, "Please raise your eyes and see, from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward.15For all the land that you see I will give to you and to your seed to eternity.16And I will make your seed like the dust of the earth, so that if a man will be able to count the dust of the earth, so will your seed be counted.17Rise, walk in the land, to its length and to its breadth, for I will give it to you."18And Abram pitched his tents, and he came, and he dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.1Now it came to pass in the days of Amraphel the king of Shinar, Arioch the king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and Tidal the king of Goyim.2That they waged war with Bera the king of Sodom and with Birsha the king of Gomorrah, Shineab the king of Admah, and Shemeber the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.3All these joined in the valley of Siddim, which is the Dead Sea.4For twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and for thirteen years they rebelled.5And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and they smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim.6And the Horites in their mountain Seir, until the plain of Paran, which is alongside the desert.7And they returned and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh, and they smote the entire field of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.8And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar, came forth, and they engaged them in battle in the valley of Siddim.9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam and Tidal the king of Goyim and Amraphel the king of Shinar and Arioch the king of Ellasar, four kings against the five.10Now the valley of Siddim was [composed of] many clay pits, and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and they fell there, and the survivors fled to a mountain.11And they took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food, and they departed.12And they took Lot and his possessions, the son of Abram's brother, and they departed, and he was living in Sodom.13And the fugitive came and he told Abram the Hebrew, and he was living in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshkol and the brother of Aner, who were Abram's confederates.14And Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, and he armed his trained men, those born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and he pursued [them] until Dan.15And he divided himself against them at night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them until Hobah, which is to the left of Damascus.16And he restored all the possessions, and also Lot his brother and his possessions he restored, and also the women and the people.17And the king of Sodom came out toward him, after his return from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, to the valley of Shaveh, which is the valley of the king.18And Malchizedek the king of Salem brought out bread and wine, and he was a priest to the Most High God.19And he blessed him, and he said, "Blessed be Abram to the Most High God, Who possesses heaven and earth.20And blessed be the Most High God, Who has delivered your adversaries into your hand," and he gave him a tithe from all.21And the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the souls, and the possessions take for yourself."22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I raise my hand to the Lord, the Most High God, Who possesses heaven and earth.23Neither from a thread to a shoe strap, nor will I take from whatever is yours, that you should not say, 'I have made Abram wealthy.'24Exclusive of what the lads ate, and the share of the men who went with me; Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre they shall take their share."1After these incidents, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Fear not, Abram; I am your Shield; your reward is exceedingly great."2And Abram said, "O Lord God, what will You give me, since I am going childless, and the steward of my household is Eliezer of Damascus?"3And Abram said, "Behold, You have given me no seed, and behold, one of my household will inherit me."4And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, "This one will not inherit you, but the one who will spring from your innards-he will inherit you."5And He took him outside, and He said, "Please look heavenward and count the stars, if you are able to count them." And He said to him, "So will be your seed."6And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him as righteousness.7And He said to him, "I am the Lord, Who brought you forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."8And he said, "O Lord God, how will I know that I will inherit it?"9And He said to him, "Take for Me three heifers and three goats and three rams, and a turtle dove and a young bird."10And he took for Him all these, and he divided them in the middle, and he placed each part opposite its mate, but he did not divide the birds.11And the birds of prey descended upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.12Now the sun was ready to set, and a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and behold, a fright, a great darkness was falling upon him.13And He said to Abram, "You shall surely know that your seed will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and they will enslave them and oppress them, for four hundred years.14And also the nation that they will serve will I judge, and afterwards they will go forth with great possessions.15But you will come to your forefathers in peace; you will be buried in a good old age.16And the fourth generation will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites will not be complete until then."17Now it came to pass that the sun had set, and it was dark, and behold, a smoking furnace and a fire brand, which passed between these parts.18On that day, the Lord formed a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt until the great river, the Euphrates river.19The Kenites, the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,20And the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaim,21And the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites."1Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne to him, and she had an Egyptian handmaid named Hagar.2And Sarai said to Abram, "Behold now, the Lord has restrained me from bearing; please come to my handmaid; perhaps I will be built up from her." And Abram hearkened to Sarai's voice.3So Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, at the end of ten years of Abram's dwelling in the land of Canaan, and she gave her to Abram her husband for a wife.4And he came to Hagar, and she conceived, and she saw that she was pregnant, and her mistress became unimportant in her eyes.5And Sarai said to Abram, "May my injustice be upon you! I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and she saw that she had become pregnant, and I became unimportant in her eyes. May the Lord judge between me and you!"6And Abram said to Sarai, "Here is your handmaid in your hand; do to her that which is proper in your eyes." And Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from before her.7And an angel of the Lord found her by a water fountain in the desert, by the fountain on the road to Shur.8And he said, "Hagar, Sarai's servant, where are you coming from, and where are you going to?" And she said, "From before Sarai my mistress, I am fleeing."9And the angel of the Lord said to her, "Return to your mistress, and allow yourself to be afflicted under her hands."10And the angel of the Lord said to her, "I will greatly multiply your seed, and it will not be counted for abundance."11And the angel of the Lord said to her, "Behold, you will conceive and bear a son, and you shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard your affliction.12And he will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be upon all, and everyone's hand upon him, and before all his brothers he will dwell."13And she called the name of the Lord, Who had spoken to her, "You are the God of seeing," because she said, "Have I seen[him]here also after I have seen?"14Therefore the well was called Be'er Lachai Ro'i; behold it is between Kadesh and between Bered.15And Hagar bore a son to Abram, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar had borne, Ishmael.16And Abram was eighty-six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.1And Abram was ninety-nine years old, and God appeared to Abram, and He said to him, "I am the Almighty God; walk before Me and be perfect.2And I will place My covenant between Me and between you, and I will multiply you very greatly."3And Abram fell upon his face, and God spoke with him, saying,4"As for Me, behold My covenant is with you, and you shall become the father of a multitude of nations.5And your name shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.6And I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings will emerge from you.7And I will establish My covenant between Me and between you and between your seed after you throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant, to be to you for a God and to your seed after you.8And I will give you and your seed after you the land of your sojournings, the entire land of Canaan for an everlasting possession, and I will be to them for a God."9And God said to Abraham, "And you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.10This is My covenant, which you shall observe between Me and between you and between your seed after you, that every male among you be circumcised.11And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be as the sign of a covenant between Me and between you.12And at the age of eight days, every male shall be circumcised to you throughout your generations, one that is born in the house, or one that is purchased with money, from any foreigner, who is not of your seed.13Those born in the house and those purchased for money shall be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.14And an uncircumcised male, who will not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin-that soul will be cut off from its people; he has broken My covenant."15And God said to Abraham, "Your wife Sarai-you shall not call her name Sarai, for Sarah is her name.16And I will bless her, and I will give you a son from her, and I will bless her, and she will become [a mother of] nations; kings of nations will be from her. "17And Abraham fell on his face and rejoiced, and he said to himself, "Will [a child] be born to one who is a hundred years old, and will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?"18And Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael will live before You!"19And God said, "Indeed, your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac, and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.20And regarding Ishmael, I have heard you; behold I have blessed him, and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him exceedingly; he will beget twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.21But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year."22And He finished speaking with him, and God went up from above Abraham.23And Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house and all those purchased with his money, every male of the people of Abraham's household, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day, as God had spoken with him.24And Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised of the flesh of his foreskin.25And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised of the flesh of his foreskin.26On that very day, Abraham was circumcised, and [so was] Ishmael his son.27And all the people of his household, those born in his house and those bought with money from foreigners, were circumcised with him.1Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he was sitting at the entrance of the tent when the day was hot.2And he lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing beside him, and he saw and he ran toward them from the entrance of the tent, and he prostrated himself to the ground.
