2And your fear and your dread shall be upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the fowl of the heaven; upon everything that creeps upon the ground and upon all the fish of the sea, they have been given into your hand[s].3Every moving thing that lives shall be yours to eat; like the green vegetation, I have given you everything.4But, flesh with its soul, its blood, you shall not eat.5But your blood, of your souls, I will demand [an account]; from the hand of every beast I will demand it, and from the hand of man, from the hand of each man, his brother, I will demand the soul of man.6Whoever sheds the blood of man through man shall his blood be shed, for in the image of God He made man.7And you, be fruitful and multiply; swarm upon the earth and multiply thereon."8And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:9"And I, behold I am setting up My covenant with you and with your seed after you.10And with every living creature that is with you, among the fowl, among the cattle, and among all the beasts of the earth with you, of all those who came out of the ark, of all the living creatures of the earth.11And I will establish My covenant with you, and never again will all flesh be cut off by the flood waters, and there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth."12And God said: "This is the sign of the covenant, which I am placing between Me and between you, and between every living soul that is with you, for everlasting generations.13My rainbow I have placed in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Myself and the earth.14And it shall come to pass, when I cause clouds to come upon the earth, that the rainbow will appear in the cloud.15And I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and between you and between every living creature among all flesh, and the water will no longer become a flood to destroy all flesh.16And the rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will see it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and between every living creature among all flesh, which is on the earth."17And God said to Noah: "This is the sign of the covenant that I have set up, between Myself and between all flesh that is on the earth."18And the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham he was the father of Canaan.19These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the entire earth spread out.20And Noah began to be a master of the soil, and he planted a vineyard.21And he drank of the wine and became drunk, and he uncovered himself within his tent.22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness, and he told his two brothers outside.23And Shem and Japheth took the garment, and they placed [it] on both of their shoulders, and they walked backwards, and they covered their father's nakedness, and their faces were turned backwards, so that they did not see their father's nakedness.24And Noah awoke from his wine, and he knew what his small son had done to him.25And he said, "Cursed be Canaan; he shall be a slave among slaves to his brethren."26And he said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem, and may Canaan be a slave to them.27May God expand Japheth, and may He dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be a slave to them."28And Noah lived after the Flood, three hundred and fifty years.29And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.1And these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and sons were born to them after the Flood.2The sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal, and Meshech and Tiras.3And the sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.4And the sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.5From these, the islands of the nations separated in their lands, each one to his language, according to their families, in their nations.6And the sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.7And the sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabta and Raamah and Sabtecha, and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.8And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty man in the land.9He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord."10And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.11From that land emerged Asshur, and he built Nineveh and Rehoboth ir and Calah.12And Resen, between Nineveh and between Calah; that is the great city.13And Mizraim begot the Ludim and the Anamim and the Lehabim and the Naphtuhim,14And the Pathrusim and the Casluhim, from whom the Philistines emerged, and the Caphtorim.15And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn and Heth.16And the Jebusites and the Amorites and the Girgashites.17And the Hivvites and the Arkites and the Sinites.18And the Arvadites and the Zemarites and the Hamathites, and afterwards the families of the Canaanites were scattered.19And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you come to Gerar, until Gaza, as you come to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboiim, until Lesha.20These are the sons of Ham according to their families, and their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.21And to Shem were also born the father of all the people of the other side, the brother of Japheth the elder.
